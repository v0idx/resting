# resting
## A simple command line utility to make http requests

#### Description
resting aims to be an all in one command line utility to make http requests, and then view the responses. On top of being functional, I also hope to further my knowledge of Rust and it's crates through this project.

#### Current Ability
Currently, resting is able to make head requests, a small start, but I'm excited to add future functionality. The response is currently outputed directly to console.

#### TODO
* File output support
* Other HTTP Request Type support
* Authentication Support
* Query Support
* File input for POST
* Proper Error Handling
* Code Documentation

#### Usage
As this project is still in development, the easiest way to run it (for whatever reason you would want to use a utility that can make 1 type of request) is to run `cargo build` and then run the utility from the target/dev directory.
